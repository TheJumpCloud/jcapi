*JumpCloud's Go (golang) REST API SDK (BETA)*
Copyright (C) 2015 JumpCloud

This JumpCloud SDK is in beta form. The only available documentation comes in the form of the included examples and from jcapi_test.go (best stuff is in there).

Two things to keep in mind as you use this:
 * Use it at your own risk.
 * Please know that this SDK will change over time.

This API exposes several JumpCloud REST APIs:
 * System Users - (see https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/JumpCloudAPI#system-users)
 * Systems - (see https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/JumpCloudAPI#systems)
 * Identity Sources - not yet documented
 * Tags - (see https://github.com/TheJumpCloud/JumpCloudAPI#tags)
 * Authentication and Authorization - (see http://support.jumpcloud.com/knowledgebase/articles/455570)
